# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code where possible, that means check for other areas of code that might already have similar code
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, prod
- Be careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change requested
- When fixing a bug or issue, do not introduce a new pattern, technology, or dependency without exhausting all options for the existing implementation. You will have to justify why you are rewriting code if you must do so
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Only mock data for tests, not for dev or prod
- Never overwrite my .env file
- Run the commands "npm run dev" and "npm run build" to validate there are no errors after you complete your work
